# Testing Channels with Multiple Clients

## You Have 3 Clients Connected! üéâ

Now let's test channel functionality:

---

## Basic Channel Commands

### 1. **Join a Channel**

In **Client 1:**
```
/join #test
```

In **Client 2:**
```
/join #test
```

In **Client 3:**
```
/join #test
```

‚úÖ All three clients are now in the same channel!

---

### 2. **Send Messages to Channel**

In **Client 1:**
```
Hello everyone!
```

In **Client 2:**
```
Hi there!
```

‚úÖ All clients in #test should see these messages!

---

### 3. **Send Private Messages**

If Client 1 wants to message Client 2 privately:

In **Client 1:**
```
/msg client2nick Hey, private message!
```

‚úÖ Only Client 2 will see this message

---

### 4. **List Who's in Channel**

```
/names #test
```

Or:
```
/who #test
```

---

### 5. **Set Channel Topic**

In **Client 1:**
```
/topic #test Welcome to our test channel!
```

‚úÖ All clients will see the topic change

---

### 6. **Leave a Channel**

In **Client 3:**
```
/part #test
```

Or with a message:
```
/part #test Goodbye everyone!
```

‚úÖ Client 3 leaves, others remain in channel

---

### 7. **Kick a User** (if you're channel operator)

In **Client 1** (channel creator is usually operator):
```
/kick #test client2nick
```

Or with a reason:
```
/kick #test client2nick Please behave!
```

---

### 8. **Invite Someone to Channel**

In **Client 1:**
```
/invite client3nick #test
```

---

## Full Test Scenario

### Step-by-Step Test:

#### **Client 1 (Alice):**
```
/nick alice
/join #mychannel
```
You'll see: `* Now talking in #mychannel`

#### **Client 2 (Bob):**
```
/nick bob
/join #mychannel
```
You'll see: 
- `* Now talking in #mychannel`
- Alice sees: `* bob has joined #mychannel`

#### **Client 3 (Charlie):**
```
/nick charlie
/join #mychannel
```
Everyone sees: `* charlie has joined #mychannel`

#### **In #mychannel (everyone can type):**

**Alice:**
```
Hello everyone!
```

**Bob:**
```
Hi Alice!
```

**Charlie:**
```
Hey folks!
```

‚úÖ Everyone sees all messages!

---

## Set Topic

**Alice (as channel creator):**
```
/topic #mychannel This is our test channel
```

Everyone sees: `* Topic for #mychannel is: This is our test channel`

---

## Private Message Test

**Alice (send private message to Bob):**
```
/msg bob This is a secret message
```

‚úÖ Only Bob sees it in a separate window/tab

---

## Test PART (Leave Channel)

**Charlie:**
```
/part #mychannel
```

Alice and Bob see: `* charlie has left #mychannel`

---

## Test Multiple Channels

**Alice:**
```
/join #channel1
/join #channel2
```

**Bob:**
```
/join #channel1
```

**Charlie:**
```
/join #channel2
```

Now Alice is in both, Bob in #channel1, Charlie in #channel2!

Switch between channels in HexChat by clicking the tabs.

---

## Advanced Tests

### Test KICK:

**Alice (in #mychannel):**
```
/kick #mychannel bob You've been kicked!
```

Bob gets removed from the channel.

---

### Test INVITE:

**Alice:**
```
/invite charlie #mychannel
```

Charlie receives an invite to join #mychannel.

---

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ **Working Features:**
- Creating channels (first person to JOIN creates it)
- Multiple people joining the same channel
- Broadcasting messages to everyone in channel
- Private messages between users
- Topic setting and viewing
- Leaving channels (PART)
- Kicking users (KICK)
- Inviting users (INVITE)

### üîç **Check in Server Console:**

You should see output like:
```
Nickname set to alice
Nickname set to bob
Nickname set to charlie
Client registered: alice!alice
Client registered: bob!bob
Client registered: charlie!charlie
```
