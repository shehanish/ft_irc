# Username Change Feature

## Overview
Your IRC server now supports **changing username after registration**! This is in addition to nickname changes.

---

## How to Change Username

After connecting and registering, you can change your username using:

```
/quote USER newusername 0 * :New Real Name
```

Or in HexChat:
```
/raw USER newusername 0 * :New Real Name
```

### Example:
```
/quote USER johndoe 0 * :John Doe
```

You'll see:
```
-localhost- Username changed from shehani to johndoe
```

## How to Change Nickname

```
/nick newnickname
```

---

## What Changed

### Before ‚ùå
- Username was locked after registration
- Attempting to change would get: "462 You may not reregister"

### After ‚úÖ
- Username can be changed anytime
- Server sends a NOTICE confirming the change
- Real name also updates

---

## Commands Summary

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/nick name` | Change nickname | `/nick sheha` |
| `/quote USER user 0 * :real` | Change username & realname | `/quote USER john 0 * :John Smith` |
