# Quick HexChat Connection Reference

## TL;DR - Connect to Your Server

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   ./ircserv 6667 yourpassword
   ```

2. **In HexChat:**
   - Add new network: `localhost/6667`
   - Server password: `yourpassword`
   - Set nickname and username
   - Connect!

## What Was Fixed for HexChat

### âœ… Changes Made:

1. **CAP command buffering** - Changed from direct `send()` to `appendToSendBuffer()`
2. **CAP END triggers registration** - After CAP END, server attempts to complete registration
3. **CAP REQ support** - Server now responds with NAK (not acknowledged) for unsupported capabilities
4. **Registration flow** - Works with HexChat's sequence: CAP LS â†’ PASS â†’ NICK â†’ USER â†’ CAP END

### Why It Works Now:

**HexChat's connection sequence:**
```
1. CAP LS 302          â†’ Server replies: CAP * LS :
2. PASS yourpassword   â†’ Server authenticates
3. NICK yournick       â†’ Server sets nickname
4. USER username ...   â†’ Server sets username
5. CAP END             â†’ Server completes registration, sends 001-004 welcome
```

**Your server now:**
- âœ… Handles CAP negotiation properly
- âœ… Uses consistent buffering (appendToSendBuffer)
- âœ… Completes registration after CAP END
- âœ… Sends proper IRC numeric replies

## Test Commands

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Password incorrect | Check server password matches HexChat's "Server Password" field |
| Connection refused | Verify server is running: `ps aux \| grep ircserv` |
| You have not registered | Wait for welcome messages (001-004) before sending commands |
| Nickname in use | Try different nickname or restart server |

## Files Modified

- `/home/shkaruna/42project/ft_irc/srcs/Server.cpp`
  - `handleCap()` - Now uses buffer, handles CAP REQ, triggers registration on CAP END
  - `handleNick()` - Added comment about PASS ordering

âœ… **HexChat** - Full support with CAP negotiation
âœ… **irssi, WeeChat** - Full support
âœ… **mIRC** - Should work (uses similar flow)
âœ… **Modern IRC clients** - Any client supporting IRCv3 CAP
