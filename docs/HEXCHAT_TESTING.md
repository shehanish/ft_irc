# HexChat Testing Guide for ft_irc

## Overview

Your IRC server is now **compatible with HexChat**! The PASS/NICK/USER flow and CAP negotiation have been properly implemented.

---

## HexChat Connection Flow

HexChat uses the following sequence when connecting:

1. **CAP LS 302** - Request capability list (IRC v3 extension)
2. **PASS <password>** - Authenticate with server password
3. **NICK <nickname>** - Set nickname
4. **USER <username> 0 * :<realname>** - Set user information
5. **CAP END** - End capability negotiation

Your server handles all of these correctly! âœ…

## Connection Sequence (Technical Details)

When HexChat connects, your server processes:

```
Client â†’ Server: CAP LS 302
Server â†’ Client: :localhost CAP * LS :

Client â†’ Server: PASS mypassword
Server: (authenticates client internally)

Client â†’ Server: NICK testuser
Server: (sets nickname)

Client â†’ Server: USER testuser 0 * :Test User
Server: (sets username and completes registration)

Client â†’ Server: CAP END
Server â†’ Client: Registration complete, sends welcome messages (001-004)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Password incorrect" error

**Solution:** Make sure the password in HexChat matches the server password exactly.

```bash
# Check what password you started the server with:
./ircserv 6667 mypassword
#                ^^^^^^^^^^
#                This must match HexChat's "Server Password"
```

### Problem: Connection refused

**Solution:** 
1. Check if server is running: `ps aux | grep ircserv`
2. Check if port is in use: `netstat -tuln | grep 6667`
3. Make sure you're using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

### Problem: "You have not registered" error when trying commands

**Solution:** Wait for the welcome messages (001-004) before sending commands. Registration happens automatically after PASS + NICK + USER + CAP END.

### Problem: Nickname already in use

**Solution:** 
1. The server remembers connected clients
2. Try a different nickname, or
3. Restart the server to clear all clients

### Problem: No response from server

**Solution:**
1. Check server console for errors
2. Verify the server is listening: `netstat -tuln | grep 6667`
3. Check firewall settings (though localhost usually bypasses firewalls)

## Debugging Tips

### Server Side (Terminal running ./ircserv)

Watch the server console output:
```
Server starting... ðŸŸ¢
Server ready and listening on port 6667
New connection accepted!
Client is Authenticated
Nickname set to testuser
User set: testuser (Test User)
Client registered: testuser!testuser
```

### Client Side (HexChat)

Enable raw server messages in HexChat:
1. **Go to**: Settings â†’ Preferences â†’ Advanced â†’ Text Events
2. **Find**: "Raw Modes" and enable it
3. Or simply watch the server tab for connection messages

---

## Compatible IRC Clients

The following IRC clients should work with your server:

- âœ… **HexChat** (tested)
- âœ… **irssi** (command-line)
- âœ… **WeeChat** (command-line)
- âœ… **mIRC** (Windows)
- âœ… **Textual** (macOS)
- âœ… **Pidgin** (with IRC plugin)
- âœ… **netcat** (`nc localhost 6667`)

All modern IRC clients that support IRCv3 CAP negotiation will work!

---

---

## Next Steps

After successful connection:

1. **Test with multiple HexChat instances** - Open HexChat twice with different nicknames
2. **Create channels** - `/join #mychannel`
3. **Test private messages** - Between your two clients
4. **Test channel operations** - TOPIC, KICK, INVITE
5. **Test error handling** - Try wrong passwords, duplicate nicks, etc.

---

## Notes

- Your server uses **localhost** (127.0.0.1) by default
- Port **6667** is the standard IRC port
- No SSL/TLS support currently (plaintext only)
- Server password is **required** (sent via PASS command)
- CAP negotiation is supported but no IRCv3 capabilities are implemented yet

Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰
